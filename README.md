# Reversing-an-Array-x86-Assembly
In this project, I implemented a program in x86-64 assembly language to reverse an array of integers and print both the original and reversed arrays using the `printf` function. This was done as part of Ethan Welborn's class, where the primary goal was to gain hands-on experience with low-level programming concepts.

The program was developed using Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) syntax. I created a `ReverseArray` procedure to efficiently reverse the order of elements in the array and employed registers like `rsi`, `rdi`, `r8`, `r14`, and `r15` to manipulate memory efficiently. The program also integrated standard C libraries (`ucrt.lib` and `legacy_stdio_definitions.lib`) for linking the `printf` function and ensuring proper output handling.

One of the main achievements was successfully reversing the array in place, demonstrating my ability to work with low-level memory manipulation. I implemented a loop that printed both the original and reversed arrays using `printf`. Additionally, I ensured the program terminated properly by calling the `ExitProcess` function with a return code of 0.

This project allowed me to showcase a variety of skills, including x86-64 assembly programming, memory manipulation, in-place array reversal, and integrating C runtime libraries. It also strengthened my knowledge of low-level programming techniques and efficient use of system resources.

The program serves as a functional example of my proficiency in assembly language and algorithmic data structure manipulation. It was developed as part of a class project and successfully met the objectives of demonstrating key concepts in low-level programming.

This project deepened my understanding of low-level programming concepts, optimized memory usage, and honed my skills in x86-64 assembly language, providing a solid foundation for more complex programming challenges.

I am excited to further explore projects that lie at the intersection of hardware and software, applying my low-level programming skills to solve more complex and challenging problems.
