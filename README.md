# Reversing-an-Array-x86-Assembly
🚀 Project Overview:
Implemented a program in x86-64 assembly language to reverse an array of integers and print both the original and reversed arrays using the printf function as part of Ethan Welborn's class.

💻 Technical Details:
Utilized Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) syntax.
Developed a ReverseArray procedure to efficiently reverse the order of elements in the array.
Employed registers (rsi, rdi, r8, r14, r15, etc.) for optimized memory manipulation.
Integrated standard C libraries (ucrt.lib, legacy_stdio_definitions.lib) for linking.

🔍 Key Achievements:
Successfully reversed the array in-place, demonstrating proficiency in low-level programming.
Implemented a loop to print both the original and reversed arrays using the printf function.
Ensured proper program termination by calling the ExitProcess function with a return code of 0.

🎓 Skills Demonstrated:
x86-64 Assembly, Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), Memory Manipulation, In-Place Array Reversal, Low-Level Programming, C Runtime Library Integration.

🌐 Outcome:
A functional program showcasing expertise in assembly language programming and algorithmic manipulation of data structures, developed in Ethan Welborn's class.

📈 Impact:
Enhanced understanding of low-level programming concepts, optimized memory usage, and improved proficiency in x86-64 assembly language.

🙌 Next Steps:
Excited to explore more projects at the intersection of hardware and software, leveraging low-level programming skills to solve complex challenges.
